Title: Gaussian Conditional Autoregressive MLE
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Noah Bolanos
Maintainer: <ncbolano@tamu.edu>
Description: This package conducts maximum likelihood estimation to estimate 
the three parameters (mu , rho , tau) of a Gaussian CAR model. Provided with 
an Nx1 vector of observations, and a valid proximity matrix corresponding to 
the regional structure of the data, it computes the Least Squared estimators. 
Then, these LS estimators are utilized as warm starting values to iterate 
through our negative likelihood function and find optimal MLE parameters. 
Finally, it analyzes the inverse hessian to relay the variance of each of 
our MLE's. proxGCAR returns a 3x3 matrix of the LS estimators , MLE's , 
and corresponding MLE variances. For more information about the model and 
parameters, refer to ReadME, found here.
